Hello! I've decided to finally creating a blog after kicking around the idea
for a while. I've chosen to use Jekyll and host with Github; we'll see how well
this works. I'm still learning Markdown and how to masterfully customize Jekyll,
 but am liking what I see so far! I'll hopefully be posting on a semi-regular
 basis about everything from software development to random projects to new
 tidbits that I think will be interesting or useful.

So without further ado, here it is:

```
print("Hello World!")
```

I'm looking forward to sharing new things I learn!
