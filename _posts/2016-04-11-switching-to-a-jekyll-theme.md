# This blog looks different!
Yep, I decided to go with the snazzy [HPSTR theme] instead of further extending [Jekyll Now]. I had a good deal of fun customizing Jekyll Now, but I simply couldn't pass up switching to a more aesthetically complete theme after I saw [so] very [many] different [beautiful themes]. One Product Hunt click led to another, and I ooh'd and ahh'd appropriately but one thing was common amongst the best themes: they packaged all the features I was looking for, directly *out of the box*. With Jekyll Now, I've been making slow improvements through the HTML templates and looking through pull requests, but that simply doesn't compare to something as sexy as [this]. Huge shoutout to [Michael Rose] for creating the awesome HPSTR theme!

I kept the old blog around [here]. 
# To what you see!
And the good news is that it's only going to get better! I can still customize this HPSTR theme and play with some features (such as displaying only excerpts ont the front page). The great thing is that now I don't **have** to in order to have a beautiful, professional looking blog - which means hopefully more writing, less tinkering. 

Anyways, until next time - enjoy the new look! Same content, same posts, just presented in a much more HPSTR fashion.
