# The Tech of adViz
adViz was designed not as just a mobile app or a website, but as a comprehensive solution. The main parts are the iOS application, the web application, and the backend that integrates with existing police systems. For the MVP, I created the web application and had a UI app skeleton for the iOS application.

Feel free to check out the adViz demo. Some features have been disabled, but general sense of the MVP is there:
