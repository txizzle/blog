# The Tech of adViz
adViz was designed not as just a mobile app or a website, but as a comprehensive solution. The complete vision includes the iOS application, the web application, and the backend that integrates with existing police systems. For the MVP, I created the web application and skeleton UI for the iOS application.

As adViz may be developed further in the future, I won't delve extremely deeply into the codebase. However, I'll be pointing out key APIs, templates, and resources I found useful. 

## The Tech Stack
First and foremost, let's talk tools. To build the MVP, I used to some extent the following:

* [Meteor] for UI, web server, data platform, and deployment
* [Iron Router] for routing
* [MongoDB] for database
* [Bootstrap] for UI
* [AdminLTE] for dashboard UI
* [Autoform] for forms UI
* [Twilio] for SMS
* [Facebook Chat API] for FB Chat
* [Chart.js] for data visualization
* [Google Maps] for maps and navigation
* [IBM Watson] for cognitive computing

I coded with Brackets.io, which I absolute love for front-end and full-stack work. 

## Dashboard UI
I used AdminLTE and customized multiple aspects to 'meteor-ize' it. It was my first time working with Meteor on a significantly large project, so I had to refactor many components and turn them into templates. Unforunately, I did not find available Meteor Dashboard templates sufficient, which is why I had to go this route and port over a pure HTML/CSS dashboard template. 

## Multi-platform Alerts
For the MVP, I implemented Facebook and SMS alert mesages, and sketched out how Twitter alerts would work. 

Facebook messages are actually a bit tricky to implement, as Facebook [removed] the official Chat API service two years ago. The workaround was to use the [unofficial NPM Facebook chat package] and port it over to Meteor. *Update: Meteor 1.3 supports using `npm install` directly, which is awesome!*

SMS messages were easy to hook up with Twilio. My team was able to receive $500 in credit from Twilio, which made developing painless and fun. Thanks Twilio!
