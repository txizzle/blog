Hi! I'm a student at UC Berkeley currently pursuing an M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I enjoy learning and exploring a vast array of topics, so hopefully you'll find something on here that piques your interest. The main topics I plan to write about are software engineering, machine learning, and awesome teams.
